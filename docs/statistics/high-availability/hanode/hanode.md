<table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Data Type</th><th>Permissions</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>clearstats</td><td>&lt;String></td><td>Read-write</td><td>Clear the statsistics / counters.<br>Possible values = basic, full</td></tr><tr><td>hacurstatus</td><td>&lt;String></td><td>Read-only</td><td>Whether a Citrix ADC is configured for high availability. Possible values are YES and NO. If the value is NO, the high availability statistics below are invalid.</td></tr><tr><td>hacurstate</td><td>&lt;String></td><td>Read-only</td><td>State of the HA node, based on its health, in a high availability setup. Possible values are: UP - Indicates that the node is accessible and can function as either a primary or secondary node. DISABLED - Indicates that the high availability status of the node has been manually disabled. Synchronization and propagation cannot take place between the peer nodes. INIT - Indicates that the node is in the process of becoming part of the high availability configuration. PARTIALFAIL - Indicates that one of the high availability monitored interfaces has failed because of a card or link failure. This state triggers a failover. COMPLETEFAIL - Indicates that all the interfaces of the node are unusable, because the interfaces on which high availability monitoring is enabled are not connected or are manually disabled. This state triggers a failover. DUMB - Indicates that the node is in listening mode. It does not participate in high availability transitions or transfer configuration from the peer node. This is a configured value, not a statistic. PARTIALFAILSSL - Indicates that the SSL card has failed. This state triggers a failover. ROUTEMONITORFAIL - Indicates that the route monitor has failed. This state triggers a failover.</td></tr><tr><td>hacurmasterstate</td><td>&lt;String></td><td>Read-only</td><td>Indicates the high availability state of the node. Possible values are: STAYSECONDARY - Indicates that the selected node remains the secondary node in a high availability setup. In this case a forced failover does not change the state but, instead, returns an appropriate error message. This is a configured value and not a statistic. PRIMARY - Indicates that the selected node is the primary node in a high availability setup. SECONDARY - Indicates that the selected node is the secondary node in a high availability setup. CLAIMING - Indicates that the secondary node is in the process of taking over as the primary node. This is the intermediate state in the transition of the secondary node to primary status. FORCE CHANGE - Indicates that the secondary node is forcibly changing its status to primary due to a forced failover issued on the secondary node.</td></tr><tr><td>transtime</td><td>&lt;String></td><td>Read-only</td><td>Time when the last master state transition occurred. You can use this statistic for debugging.</td></tr><tr><td>hatotpktrx</td><td>&lt;Double></td><td>Read-only</td><td>Number of heartbeat packets received from the peer node. Heartbeats are sent at regular intervals (default is 200 milliseconds) to determine the state of the peer node.</td></tr><tr><td>hapktrxrate</td><td>&lt;Double></td><td>Read-only</td><td>Rate (/s) counter for hatotpktrx</td></tr><tr><td>hatotpkttx</td><td>&lt;Double></td><td>Read-only</td><td>Number of heartbeat packets sent to the peer node. Heartbeats are sent at regular intervals (default is 200 milliseconds) to determine the state of the peer node.</td></tr><tr><td>hapkttxrate</td><td>&lt;Double></td><td>Read-only</td><td>Rate (/s) counter for hatotpkttx</td></tr><tr><td>haerrproptimeout</td><td>&lt;Double></td><td>Read-only</td><td>Number of times propagation timed out.</td></tr><tr><td>haerrsyncfailure</td><td>&lt;Double></td><td>Read-only</td><td>Number of times the configuration of the primary and secondary nodes failed to synchronize since that last transition. A synchronization failure results in mismatched configuration. It can be caused by a mismatch in the Remote Procedural Call (RPC) password on the two nodes forming the high availability pair.</td></tr></tbody></table>

Some options that you can use for each operations:
<ul><li><p><b>Getting warnings in response:</b>NITRO allows you to get warnings in an operation by specifying the "warning" query parameter as "yes". For example, to get warnings while connecting to the NetScaler appliance, the URL is as follows:</p><p>http://<span style="color:green;font-style:italic;">&lt;netscaler-ip-address&gt;</span>/nitro/v1/config/login?warning=yes</p><p>If any, the warnings are displayed in the response payload with the HTTP code "209 X-NITRO-WARNING".</p></li><li><p><b>Authenticated access for individual NITRO operations:</b>NITRO allows you to logon to the NetScaler appliance to perform individual operations. You can use this option instead of creating a NITRO session (using the login object) and then using that session to perform all operations,</p><p>To do this, you must specify the username and password in the request header of the NITRO request as follows:</p><p>X-NITRO-USER:<span style="color:green;font-style:italic;">&lt;username&gt;</span></p><p>X-NITRO-PASS:<span style="color:green;font-style:italic;">&lt;password&gt;</span></p><p><b>Note:</b>In such cases, make sure that the request header DOES not include the following:</p><p>Cookie:NITRO_AUTH_TOKEN=<span style="color:green;font-style:italic;">&lt;tokenvalue&gt;</span></p></li></ul>
