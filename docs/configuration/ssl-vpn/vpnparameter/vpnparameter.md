The web address or IP address is not included in the expression for the client security check.</td><tr><tr><td>clientsecuritygroup</td><td>&lt;String></td><td>Read-write</td><td>The client security group that will be assigned on failure of the client security check. Users can in general be organized into Groups. In this case, the Client Security Group may have a more restrictive security policy.&lt;br>Minimum length = 1</td><tr><tr><td>clientsecuritymessage</td><td>&lt;String></td><td>Read-write</td><td>The client security message that will be displayed on failure of the client security check.&lt;br>Minimum length = 1&lt;br>Maximum length = 127</td><tr><tr><td>clientsecuritylog</td><td>&lt;String></td><td>Read-write</td><td>Set the logging of client security checks.&lt;br>Default value: ON&lt;br>Possible values = ON, OFF</td><tr><tr><td>smartgroup</td><td>&lt;String></td><td>Read-write</td><td>Comma-separated list of groups in which the user is placed when none of the groups that the user is a part of is configured on NetScaler Gateway. The ica (smartacccess2) uses these groups in the is_member_of expressions and the vpn session policy will have the expression to check for presence of antivirus.&lt;br>Minimum length = 1&lt;br>Maximum length = 64</td><tr><tr><td>splittunnel</td><td>&lt;String></td><td>Read-write</td><td>Send, through the tunnel, traffic only for intranet applications that are defined in NetScaler Gateway. Route all other traffic directly to the Internet. The OFF setting routes all traffic through NetScaler Gateway. With the REVERSE setting, intranet applications define the network traffic that is not intercepted. All network traffic directed to internal IP addresses bypasses the VPN tunnel, while other traffic goes through NetScaler Gateway. Reverse split tunneling can be used to log all non-local LAN traffic. For example, if users have a home network and are logged on through the NetScaler Gateway Plug-in, network traffic destined to a printer or another device within the home network is not intercepted.&lt;br>Default value: OFF&lt;br>Possible values = ON, OFF, REVERSE</td><tr><tr><td>locallanaccess</td><td>&lt;String></td><td>Read-write</td><td>Set local LAN access. If split tunneling is OFF, and you set local LAN access to ON, the local client can route traffic to its local interface. When the local area network switch is specified, this combination of switches is useful. The client can allow local LAN access to devices that commonly have non-routable addresses, such as local printers or local file servers.&lt;br>Default value: OFF&lt;br>Possible values = ON, OFF</td><tr><tr><td>rfc1918</td><td>&lt;String></td><td>Read-write</td><td>As defined in the local area network, allow only the following local area network addresses to bypass the VPN tunnel when the local LAN access feature is enabled: * 10.*.*.*, * 172.16.*.*, * 192.168.*.*.&lt;br>Default value: OFF&lt;br>Possible values = ON, OFF</td><tr><tr><td>spoofiip</td><td>&lt;String></td><td>Read-write</td><td>Indicate whether or not the application requires IP spoofing, which routes the connection to the intranet application through the virtual adapter.&lt;br>Default value: ON&lt;br>Possible values = ON, OFF</td><tr><tr><td>killconnections</td><td>&lt;String></td><td>Read-write</td><td>Specify whether the NetScaler Gateway Plug-in should disconnect all preexisting connections, such as the connections existing before the user logged on to NetScaler Gateway, and prevent new incoming connections on the NetScaler Gateway Plug-in for Windows and MAC when the user is connected to NetScaler Gateway and split tunneling is disabled.&lt;br>Default value: OFF&lt;br>Possible values = ON, OFF</td><tr><tr><td>transparentinterception</td><td>&lt;String></td><td>Read-write</td><td>Allow access to network resources by using a single IP address and subnet mask or a range of IP addresses.

The default setting for authorization is to deny access to all network resources. Citrix recommends using the default global setting and then creating authorization policies to define the network resources users can access.

When a user logs on to NetScaler Gateway and is assigned an IP address, a DNS record for the user name and IP address combination is added to the NetScaler Gateway DNS cache. You can configure a DNS suffix to append to the user name when the DNS record is added to the cache.

When the web address is encrypted, the URL is different for each user session for the same web resource. If users bookmark the encoded web address, save it in the web browser and then log off, they cannot connect to the web address when they log on and use the bookmark. If users save the encrypted bookmark in the Access Interface during their session, the bookmark works each time the user logs on.&lt;br>Default value: OPAQUE&lt;br>Possible values = TRANSPARENT, OPAQUE, ENCRYPT</td><tr><tr><td>clientlesspersistentcookie</td><td>&lt;String></td><td>Read-write</td><td>State of persistent cookies in clientless access mode.

Users can open and edit Microsoft documents stored in SharePoint. * DENY - Disable persistent cookies. Users cannot open and edit Microsoft documents stored in SharePoint. * PROMPT - Prompt users to allow or deny persistent cookies during the session.

Some options that you can use for each operations:
<ul><li><p><b>Getting warnings in response:</b> NITRO allows you to get warnings in an operation by specifying the "warning" query parameter as "yes". For example, to get warnings while connecting to the NetScaler appliance, the URL is as follows:</p><p>http://<span style="color:green;font-style:italic;">&lt;netscaler-ip-address&gt;</span>/nitro/v1/config/login?warning=yes</p><p>If any, the warnings are displayed in the response payload with the HTTP code "209 X-NITRO-WARNING".</p></li><li><p><b>Authenticated access for individual NITRO operations:</b> NITRO allows you to logon to the NetScaler appliance to perform individual operations. You can use this option instead of creating a NITRO session (using the login object) and then using that session to perform all operations,</p><p>To do this, you must specify the username and password in the request header of the NITRO request as follows:</p><p>X-NITRO-USER:<span style="color:green;font-style:italic;">&lt;username&gt;</span></p><p>X-NITRO-PASS:<span style="color:green;font-style:italic;">&lt;password&gt;</span></p><p><b>Note:</b> In such cases, make sure that the request header DOES not include the following:</p><p>Cookie:NITRO_AUTH_TOKEN=<span style="color:green;font-style:italic;">&lt;tokenvalue&gt;</span></p></li></ul>
